# College Results Portal 🎓🚀

## What’s This All About?
Picture a **digital academic hub** where college results come to life! Built with the **MERN stack** (React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB), this app lets **students** peek at their grades, **lecturers** drop sessional marks, and **admins** run the show—all in one sleek platform. Think **PDF reports**, **email pings**, and secure logins, wrapped in a user-friendly bow.



## How It Works
- **Students**: Punch in your register number, and bam—see your marks, percentages, and a snazzy PDF to download.
- **Lecturers**: Log in, submit marks (e.g., “Java: 85”), and track your submissions. Secured with **JWT**.
- **Admins**: Approve marks, upload heaps of results via CSV, and check analytics—total control, zero fuss.
- **Magic Touches**: **jsPDF** crafts grade sheets, **Nodemailer** zaps updates to students, and **MongoDB** keeps it all tidy.

## Tech That Powers It
- **React**: Smooth, interactive dashboards
- **Node.js/Express.js**: Fast, reliable APIs
- **MongoDB**: Flexible data storage
- **jsPDF**: Pretty PDFs on demand
- **Nodemailer**: Email notifications
- **JWT**: Locked-down access
