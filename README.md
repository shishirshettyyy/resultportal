# College Results Portal üéì‚ú®

## What‚Äôs the Buzz?
Hey, imagine a one-stop spot where college grades get a digital glow-up! I built this with the **MERN stack** (React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB) to make life easier for everyone. **Students** can check their scores, **lecturers** drop marks, and **admins** keep it all humming‚Äîcomplete with **PDFs**, **emails**, and a sprinkle of security. It‚Äôs like a report card party online!

## How It Rolls
- **Students**: Pop in your register number, and bam‚Äîyour marks, percentages, and a cool PDF are ready to grab.
- **Lecturers**: Log in, toss in scores (like ‚ÄúJava: 85‚Äù), and keep tabs on what you‚Äôve submitted. Locked tight with **JWT**.
- **Admins**: Green-light marks, upload a ton of results with CSV, and peek at stats‚Äîall in your control zone.
- **The Fun Stuff**: **jsPDF** whips up grade sheets, **Nodemailer** shoots out updates, and **MongoDB** keeps everything neat.

## Tech That Rocks It
- **React**: Dashboards that feel alive and snappy
- **Node.js/Express.js**: APIs that zip along
- **MongoDB**: A cozy home for all that data
- **jsPDF**: PDFs that look sharp
- **Nodemailer**: Emails that land right on time
- **JWT**: Keeps the door secure

## Give It a Go
1. Snag it: `git clone https://github.com/shishirshettyyy/resultportal.git`
2. Get it ready: `npm install` (frontend and backend)
3. Add your twist: Drop `EMAIL_FROM=your-email@gmail.com` and `EMAIL_PASS=your-pass` into a `.env` file
4. Light it up: `node server.js` & `npm run dev`
5. Check it out: Swing by `http://localhost:5173`

## Neat Things Inside
- **Role Vibes**: Three dashboards, one happy app.
- **PDF Pop**: Download grades with style.
- **Bulk Wizardry**: Admins can load tons of results in a flash.
- **Instant Buzz**: Marks approved? Students get a ping right away.

## Hurdles I Jumped
- Took on **jsPDF** and won the layout game.
- Got data flowing smooth between students, lecturers, and admins.
- Made it safe and simple, no sweat.

## What‚Äôs Brewing Next?
- A mobile-friendly facelift with Tailwind CSS.
- Tests with Jest to keep it solid.
- Cool charts for admins to geek out over.
